<h1>Order Of Execution, Apex Transactions, and Governor Limits</h1>

This week (April 21st, 2020) I recorded a session on Trailhead Live on the Save Order Of Execution in Salesforce which is a topic of great interest for Salesforce Architects, Developers, App Builders and Administrators. It's so important that is covered in many Salesforce certifications.

I have also created a repo that I used on the recording to demonstrates the crazy amount of times a before update trigger can be invoked when creating a new record (over 80 times!!!)

I recommend you watch this session and play around with the project I built, and if you like it, please share it!
